# Feedback Instructions

**1st TODO:**
- Read the full document as if you were a first time FCL user (who has read the quick start and maybe looked at the kitty-items example and read some introduction somewhere about FCL).

**2nd TODO** - Please check for the following after reading it over:
-  Do all the explanations of the functions make sense and are they accurate?
-  Are the examples listed accurate/functional for their respective section? (note: could use help filling these out, many are known to be missing/broken.)
-  Do the :warning: and :loudspeaker: used properly and do they make sense?
-  Is it clear what the recommendation is (especially in terms of query/mutate vs send/decode)?
-  Does the order of items make sense? If not, how can they be better arranged?
-  Is the tone of the writing reasonable and is there any places it should be changed/reworded?
-  From your knowledge, is anything missing that should be in the reference for FCL? *(note: guides and tutorials with more hands-on help will be created elsewhere)*

**3rd TODO** - Submit Feedback:
-  Do all the explanations of the functions make sense and are they accurate?
-  Are the examples listed accurate/functional for their respective section?
-  Do the :warning: and :loudspeaker: used properly and do they make sense?
-  Is it clear what the recommendation is (especially in terms of query/mutate vs send/decode)?
-  Does the order of items make sense? If not, how can they be better arranged?
-  From your knowledge, is anything missing?

**4th TODO (optional)** - Take a look at the :tomato:'s and see if there is any additional context/info you can provide. Some tomato's are there as a reminder to fill in (ie. all the Flow types) which you can ignore, but others have questions or blanks for certain things, those are the ones that need some attention.

**How to submit (in order of preference)**
1. Direct PR with proposed changes and/or answers to the above questions.
2. A document of any kind sent over by slack or email.
3. Informal slack message with feedback
4. Meeting to deliver verbal feedback

**Note:** It's very important we get several people to look at this before putting this out, so an informal slack message with some feedback is always better than none!


**Note**: Don't worry about broken links and minor spelling mistakes, those will be fixed at the end.
